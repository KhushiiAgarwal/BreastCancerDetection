# Breast Cancer Detection
## Overview
Breast Cancer is a leading form of cancer in woman often going undetected to advanced stages, thus a detection model is built using 32 feautures. It aims to efficiently detect Breast Cancer using various ML models and demonstrates basic concepts for Machine Learning

## Feautures
* Pandas & numpy library of Python is used for basic mathematical operations on Dataset
*  sklearn is used for pre-processing data using One Hot Encoding, Variance Threshold & CHI sq
*  Sklearn is further used for deploying Linear & Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbour and Artificial Neural Networks
*  Matplotlib & Seaborn is used to visualise models and their Confusion Matrix for all algorithms used
#### Accuracy
* Linear Regression: 78.2%
* Logistic Regression: 98.8%
* K-nearest neighbour: 95.9%
* Decision Tree & Random Forest: 95% and above
