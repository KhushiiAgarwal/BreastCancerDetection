# Breast Cancer Detection
## Overview
Breast Cancer is a leading form of cancer in woman often going undetected to advanced stages, thus a detection model is built using 32 feautures. It aims to efficiently detect Breast Cancer using various ML models and demonstrates basic concepts for Machine Learning
## Feautures
*  Pandas & numpy library of Python is used for basic mathematical operations on Dataset
*  Sklearn is used for pre-processing data using One Hot Encoding, Variance Threshold & CHI sq
*  Cross Validation is performed during train-test split
*  Sklearn is further used for deploying Linear & Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine & K-nearest neighbour
*  Tensorflow is used for Artificial Neural Networks
*  Matplotlib & Seaborn is used to visualise models and their Confusion Matrix for all algorithms used.

### Setup & Installation
* Clone the repo in local Github.
* Use Google Colab or Install Jupyter
* Run the .ipnyb file and ensure to give correct path for CSV
* Now download dataset from this repository and upload it to Google Colaboratory or set appropriate path in Jupyter
* If using Jupyter/Anaconda download dataset from: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
* Install all libraries in terminal/Command Prompt (using cmd command on Windows) if using Jupyter/Anaconda
  ```
  pip install numpy
  ```
  ```
   pip install pandas
  ```
  ```
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
  ```
  pip install seaborn
  ```
  ```
  pip install tensorflow
  ```
  ```
  pip install sklearn
  ```
* Ensure dataset is present in same directory and specify the correct path
* For Google Colab, libraries are downloaded and imported during runtime
* Run the **.ipnyb** file

#### Accuracy
* Linear Regression: 78.2%
* Logistic Regression: 98.8%
* K-nearest neighbour: 95.9%
* Decision Tree & Random Forest: 95% and above
